for ceasar cipher we can use the equation((p - 'A' - k + 26) % 26) + 'A', or simply make the shift and just correct an overflow if any. in my code ive done the latter. first i initialise a variable k which is the shift. then i assign the string which is input through serial using serial.readstringuntil(\n). array z is created to store the decoded values. the ccode iterates through all elements of the input string, and first checks if it is an alphabet. if it is, it checks if it is uppercase or lowercase and shifts the charecter by k. it again checks if the decoded char has overflow and handles it by shifting it again by 26. if the char is not an alphabet, it skips the deciphering. in the end, the elements of the array z is printed.
