full adder using mux.

first we define pins of the arduino which will take our input logic and output it. then we define the pins through which we will be recieving our sum and carry of the full adder. since there was no 8x1 mux in wokwi i have made 2 8x1 mux using 2x1 mux, one which outputs the sum and the other which outputs the carry, and i connected the logic outputs from the arduino as logic input into the mux, both for my sum mux and carry mux. according to the truth table of a full adder ive given v inputs and grounding to pins 1, 2, 4, 7 of the sum mux and 3, 5, 6, 7 of my carry mux. now as th emux recieves the logic, the input into the corresponding mux pin is output, which ive set accoridng to the truth table as mentioned above. this lets me recieve the sum and carry at pins 8 and 9 of my arduino. ive made it print the sum and carry on the serial monitor and also digitalwrite pins 10 and 11 to show the sum and carry by lighitng leds.
